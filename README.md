# Advent of Code 2025 (for 3ds)
My solvers for Advent of Code 2025, written in C++ for running on 3ds. Every solver has (or will have) some kind of console and/or drawn visualization.

## Building
Set up devkitPro for 3ds development using the Windows installer or pacman on Linux.

## Running
I tested this on an original 3DS XL which has been loaded with custom firmware (CFW), running via Homebrew Launcher. devkitPro includes an app called 3dslink which makes transferring and running the binary trivial.
